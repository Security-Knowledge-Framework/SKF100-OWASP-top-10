# Welcome to the Insecure design labs chapter

Welcome to the "Insecure Design" lab environment. In this interactive and hands-on lab, you will learn how to uncover security flaws in software systems by analyzing the provided models, UML diagrams, and flowcharts.

Our primary goal is to create a requirements traceability matrix, where you will map each feature and its corresponding use cases against the potential abuse cases per use case. This exercise will help you identify vulnerabilities and better understand the risks associated with each feature.

Once you've defined the possible abuse cases, you will have the exciting opportunity to exploit the application in our lab environment. This hands-on experience will allow you to test your assumptions and see how many of the abuse cases you've identified can be verified.

By the end of this lab, you will have gained valuable insights into the world of software security and will have sharpened your skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in real-life applications. Let's dive in and start exploring the fascinating world of insecure designs!

## Four question framework

Threat modeling answers the following four key questions:

1. **What are we building?** 
   Understand the system, its context, components and their interaction, data flow, security controls, and dependencies.
   
2. **What can go wrong?**
   Identify threats and possible vulnerabilities. You could use techniques like STRIDE, attack trees or kill chains.
   
3. **What are we going to do about that?**
   Determine and implement security measures to protect the system against identified threats.
   
4. **Did we do a good enough job?**
   Validate the security measures and iterate the process. Verification can be done via methods like code review, penetration testing, and red teaming.


## Approaches to Threat Modeling

There are four general approaches to threat modeling:

1. **Asset-centric:** This approach starts by identifying and classifying a system's assets, and then focuses on the threats to those assets.
2. **System-centric (or architecture-centric):** This approach focuses on the system's design and components, and their interactions. It identifies threats based on the attack surface exposed by the system's architecture.
3. **Attacker-centric:** This approach starts by assuming the perspective of the attacker, their skills, motives, and objectives, and then identifies threats based on what parts of the system the attacker would likely target.
4. **List-centric:** List-centric approaches to threat modeling, using tools such as the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP®), provide a systematic and comprehensive checklist for evaluating the security of software applications.

## List-Centric Approaches to Threat Modeling with ASVS

**Note: the lab-guide result used the ASVS to create controls**

List-centric approaches to threat modeling, using tools such as the **Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)** from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP®), provide a systematic and comprehensive checklist for evaluating the security of software applications.

ASVS, for example, is a framework of security requirements and controls that developers and security testers can use to build and validate the security of their web applications. It covers various categories like authentication, session management, access control, input validation, error handling, data protection, communication security, and many more. Each category is broken down into detailed controls or requirements.

#### Benefits of List-Centric Approach

1. **Simplicity and Accessibility:** A checklist-based approach simplifies threat modeling by providing a set of predefined security requirements that must be addressed. This can be especially helpful for teams that don't have a dedicated security expert.
2. **Coverage:** Checklists like ASVS provide broad coverage of potential security threats, ensuring that important issues aren't overlooked. They cover various types of vulnerabilities, so you're less likely to miss an important aspect.
3. **Standardization and Consistency:** Using a standardized checklist can promote consistency in security testing, making it easier to compare and benchmark the security of different applications.
4. **Ease of Use:** Checklists can be easy to use, providing a straightforward way for teams to verify that they've addressed all relevant security issues.
5. **Documentation and Traceability:** Checklists also provide a way to document the security requirements and controls that have been implemented, which can be useful for auditing, regulatory compliance, and other purposes.

#### Limitations of List-Centric Approach

However, the checklist approach does have some limitations. It can be less effective for identifying complex, context-specific threats that aren't covered by the checklist. It might also encourage a 'tick-box' mentality, where teams just aim to satisfy the checklist without understanding the underlying security principles. Therefore, it's important to use the list-centric approach as part of a comprehensive, risk-based security program, and not as a substitute for understanding and managing security risks.

## RTM

A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a document that helps in tracking and tracing the requirements of a system throughout its development lifecycle. It establishes a clear link between the system's requirements, their origins, and the resulting design and implementation components. This helps ensure that each requirement is addressed and validated, while also providing a way to manage changes in requirements over time.

An RTM typically consists of a table or matrix with rows representing the requirements, and columns representing various stages of the development lifecycle, such as design, implementation, testing, and validation.

Let's consider a simplified example of a requirements traceability matrix for a basic e-commerce application:

| Use Case                | Abuse Case                                  | Threats                                                 | Mitigations                                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| User Registration       | Unauthorized access to user registration data | None                                                    | Implement proper access controls                        |
| Login Functionality     | Brute force attacks, password cracking       | Weak password policy, credential theft                   | Implement account lockout, strong passwords             |
| Product Search          | SQL injection, data leakage                  | Database vulnerabilities, information exposure          | Implement input sanitization, parameterized queries     |
| Shopping Cart           | Unauthorized access to shopping cart data    | Session hijacking, cross-site request forgery (CSRF)     | Implement secure session management, CSRF protection    |
| Secure Payment Processing | Payment data theft, man-in-the-middle attacks | Insecure payment handling, network interception         | Implement secure payment protocols, encryption         |
| Order Placement         | Order manipulation, price tampering          | Insecure order validation, request forgery (CSRF)        | Implement order verification mechanisms, CSRF protection |
| Customer Reviews        | Fake reviews, review manipulation            | Review spamming, improper moderation, content injection | Implement review authenticity checks, moderation process |

In this example, the Requirement ID column lists unique identifiers for each requirement, while the Requirement Description provides a brief overview of the requirement itself. The Design Component column specifies the components of the system responsible for addressing each requirement. The Test Case ID column references specific test cases designed to verify that the requirement has been implemented correctly. Lastly, the Validation Method column describes the type of testing or verification performed to validate the requirement.

An RTM can be especially useful in the context of security, as it helps identify potential vulnerabilities or abuse cases by examining the relationships between requirements, design components, and testing methods. By creating and maintaining an RTM throughout the development lifecycle, you can ensure a more secure and robust software system.
