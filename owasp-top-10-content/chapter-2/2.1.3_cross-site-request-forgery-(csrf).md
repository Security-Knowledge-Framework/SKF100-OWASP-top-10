# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web application security vulnerability that enables an attacker to manipulate and execute unauthorized actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user. The vulnerability stems from the inherent trust that web applications place in their users' browsers. In a CSRF attack, the attacker tricks the user into performing actions on a site they are already authenticated on, without the user's knowledge or consent. These actions can include changing account settings, performing transactions, or even deleting data.

The attack is executed by exploiting the web application's failure to properly validate the source of incoming requests. It typically involves crafting malicious links, embedding them in seemingly innocuous content such as emails or web pages, and then enticing the user to click on those links. When the user interacts with the malicious content, their browser inadvertently sends a request to the targeted web application, which then executes the unintended action.
