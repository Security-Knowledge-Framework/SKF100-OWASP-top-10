# Security Misconfiguration

In today's digital age, as organizations increasingly rely on software applications to streamline their operations and deliver services, ensuring the security of these applications has become a top priority. Among the numerous potential vulnerabilities that developers and administrators must address, one stands out for its prevalence and potential impact: Security Misconfiguration. Security Misconfiguration refers to the failure to adequately configure security settings and controls, leaving systems susceptible to attack.

This subject explores the various dimensions of Security Misconfiguration, its causes, and its consequences. By delving into real-world examples, we will highlight the importance of properly configuring security settings in software applications, infrastructure components, and related systems.

## Starting the lab

Link to digital ocean --> blabla1337/owasp-skf-lab:graphql-info-introspection

### Objective:

By means of using the GraphQL interospection feature, discover the user
that has the "isAdmin" privileges 

GraphQL does not provide built-in authentication by default, leaving the responsibility of implementation to developers. Consequently, this implies that GraphQL allows unrestricted querying by default, making sensitive information vulnerable to unauthorized access by attackers.
