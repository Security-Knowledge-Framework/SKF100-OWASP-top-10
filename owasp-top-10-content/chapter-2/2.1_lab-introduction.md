# Welcome to the Broken Access Controls Labs chapter

In this crucial part of the course, we will dive into the practical aspects of security by providing you with a hands-on learning experience. Through our carefully designed lab environment, you will explore and understand the various ways in which access controls can be broken or compromised, and the significant impact these vulnerabilities can have on an organization's security.

Broken access controls are a critical security risk, as they can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems, enabling attackers to bypass established security measures. As a student following this course, you will be given access to a range of exercises and real-world scenarios that will help you grasp the fundamentals of identifying, analyzing, and ultimately mitigating broken access control vulnerabilities.

By the end of the labs, you will have a solid understanding of broken access controls, their potential consequences, and the necessary steps to secure your organization's data and systems effectively. So, get ready to dive into the world of hands-on!
