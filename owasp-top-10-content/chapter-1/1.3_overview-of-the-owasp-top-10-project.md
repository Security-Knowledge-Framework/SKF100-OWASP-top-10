# Potential Impact of Security Vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for individuals, businesses, and organizations if not addressed properly. The impact of a security vulnerability depends on the nature of the vulnerability and the attacker's objectives. Some of the potential impacts include unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, and damage to an organization's reputation. In this chapter, we will discuss the potential impact of security vulnerabilities, the CIA triad, and statistics on compromised web applications.

Understanding the CIA triad is vital for application security as it provides a structure for implementing security policies and controls that protect the data and services that applications handle. It ensures that only authorized users can access data (Confidentiality), that the data they access is accurate and reliable (Integrity), and that they can access it whenever they need to (Availability). This allows for the creation of secure applications that protect both users and organizations.

## Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)

The CIA triad is a widely-used security model that emphasizes three key principles to protect information and systems:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
2. **Integrity**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have timely and reliable access to information and resources.

Security vulnerabilities can negatively impact the CIA triad in various ways:

- **Confidentiality**: Breaches may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personal information, intellectual property, or financial records. This can result in identity theft, financial fraud, or loss of competitive advantage.
- **Integrity**: An attacker could manipulate data or tamper with processing methods, causing incorrect information to be displayed or processed. This can lead to incorrect decision-making or fraudulent transactions.
- **Availability**: Vulnerabilities may be exploited to disrupt services, rendering them unavailable to legitimate users. This can result in a loss of productivity, customer dissatisfaction, or loss of revenue.
