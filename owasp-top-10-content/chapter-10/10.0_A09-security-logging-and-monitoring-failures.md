# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Security Logging and Monitoring are crucial aspects of maintaining a robust and secure web application environment. They allow system administrators and security teams to identify suspicious activities, track operational trends, detect anomalies, and respond to potential security threats on time.

## What is Security Logging?

Security Logging is the process of recording and storing actions and events within a system. This can include user activities, system errors, transactions, and more. Logs provide a traceable record of these activities and can be analyzed to uncover patterns or identify suspicious behavior.

```bash
# Example log entry:
[2023-06-09 10:15:32] - IP: 192.0.2.1 - User: exampleUser - Action: Login - Status: Success
```

## OWASP® top 10 description

Returning to the OWASP® Top 10 2021, this category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs at any time:

- Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, are not logged.
- Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages.
- Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.
- Logs are only stored locally.
- Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective.
- Penetration testing and scans by dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools (such as OWASP® ZAP) do not trigger alerts.
- The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time.
