# Introduction to Injection Attacks

Injection attacks are a type of cyber-attack where an attacker submits malicious data to a web application, which in turn gets executed or processed by the application. This can lead to unintended consequences such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or even control over the application. Among the most common types of injection attacks are SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injections. These attacks can pose serious security problems in web applications if not properly addressed.

## OWASPÂ® top 10 description

An application is vulnerable to attack when:

1. User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.

2. Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.

3. Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.

4. Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.

Some of the more common injections are:

- SQL injection
- NoSQL injection
- OS command injection
- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) injection
- LDAP injection
- Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection

The concept is identical among all interpreters. Source code review is the best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to injections. Automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged. Organizations can include static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and interactive (IAST) application security testing tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify introduced injection flaws before production deployment.
