# Introduction to LDAP Injection

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a widely used protocol for accessing and managing directory information services, such as user directories and organizational data. It is commonly used in web applications for authentication, authorization, and user management purposes.

LDAP injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate LDAP queries sent by a web application. This can lead to unauthorized access, information disclosure, and other security risks.

## How LDAP Injection Works

LDAP injection typically occurs when a web application constructs an LDAP query using user-supplied input without properly sanitizing or validating it. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious LDAP query syntax into the user input fields.

The injected LDAP query can modify the original query's behavior, allowing attackers to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information, or perform unauthorized operations on the directory service.

## Security Implications of LDAP Injection

LDAP injection can have serious security implications for web applications:

1. **Authentication bypass**: By injecting LDAP query syntax, attackers can manipulate the authentication process and bypass username and password checks. This enables unauthorized access to restricted areas of the application or sensitive data.

2. **Information disclosure**: Attackers can craft LDAP queries to retrieve sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data stored in the directory service.

3. **Data modification**: Injection attacks can modify the LDAP query to perform unauthorized operations on the directory service, such as adding, modifying, or deleting user accounts or data.

4. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attackers may abuse LDAP injection to craft malicious queries that consume excessive server resources, leading to a denial of service condition, and causing the application or system to become unavailable.
