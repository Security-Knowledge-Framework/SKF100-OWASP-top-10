# Introduction to Rogue Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Untrusted Data Sources

## Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are a key part of modern web infrastructure, designed to efficiently deliver web content to users. A CDN's main function is to serve content to users with high availability and high performance.

However, when misused, CDNs can pose significant security risks. Rogue CDNs, or malicious CDNs, are one such misuse. These rogue CDNs can serve harmful content, either by hosting malicious files directly or by serving as a conduit for malware, thus putting users at risk.

## Untrusted Data Sources

Loading data from untrusted sources, such as JavaScript (JS) files, is a common practice in web development. It's convenient because it allows developers to leverage external libraries and resources.

However, this convenience comes with a significant security risk. If the external source is compromised, the attacker can serve malicious JS files instead of legitimate ones. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, and defacement of web pages.

## Potential Security Problems

Given their potential to serve malicious content, both rogue CDNs and untrusted data sources can be significant security problems.

### 1. Data Integrity

Rogue CDNs or compromised data sources can alter the data being sent to users. This could include injecting malicious scripts into legitimate web pages or altering the functionality of web applications.

### 2. Privacy

Malicious CDNs or data sources could collect sensitive user information without consent. For example, they could track user behavior, collect form data, or even steal login credentials.

### 3. Availability

A rogue CDN could deny service to intended users or serve them slow or inaccurate content. This can be particularly damaging for businesses that rely heavily on their online presence.

Therefore, it is crucial to only use trusted CDNs and data sources when building web applications. Also, using security measures such as Subresource Integrity (SRI) can help protect against some of these risks.

## Starting the lab

### Objective:

Leverage self-XSS on the application by using the untrusted source to load malicious javascript.
Within the context of this lab, this attack only reflects on your system. Please note that in a real scenario, the URL would point to a public domain whereas all the users that are interacting with the application are targetted.
