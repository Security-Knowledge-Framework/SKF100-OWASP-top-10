# Welcome to the SSRF Labs Chapter

Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.
SSRF vulnerabilities can be difficult to exploit, but when they are, they can potentially lead to serious breaches, including sensitive data exposure, denial of service, or remote code execution. Therefore, they are a significant security concern that needs to be addressed in web applications. Mitigation strategies often involve whitelisting or validating user inputs, controlling what network requests your server-side application can make, and employing a firewall to block outgoing network connections from your server to the internal network.
