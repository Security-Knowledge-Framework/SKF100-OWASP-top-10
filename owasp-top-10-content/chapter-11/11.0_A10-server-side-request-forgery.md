# Introduction to SSRF

Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing. This means the attacker can make requests to internal resources (behind the firewall) which are normally inaccessible from the external network. SSRF can be leveraged by attackers to target other internal systems, perform actions on behalf of the server, read internal files, connect to internal services, and more.

## Description from OWASPÂ® top 10

SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).

As modern web applications provide end users with convenient features, fetching a URL becomes a common scenario. As a result, the incidence of SSRF is increasing. Also, the severity of SSRF is becoming higher due to cloud services and the complexity of architectures.
