# Objective

This exercise requires you to download and use CycloneDX and OWASP Dependency Track in order to generate and evaluate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

You can choose to do this for **Java**, **Node.js**, or **Python** according to your preference.

---

## Part 1: CycloneDX Setup and Use

### Step 1

Visit the official CycloneDX GitHub repository. Depending on the programming language you chose (Java, Node.js, or Python), download the appropriate CycloneDX tools.

### Step 2

Install the downloaded CycloneDX tool. Follow the provided installation instructions specific to your chosen language.

### Step 3

Once installed, you can use CycloneDX to create a BOM (Bill of Materials) from your project. Navigate to your project directory and run the appropriate CycloneDX command.

- For Java: `cyclonedx-maven-plugin`
- For Node.js: `cyclonedx-bom`
- For Python: `cyclonedx-python`

## Part 2: OWASP Dependency Track Setup and Use

### Step 1

Visit the official OWASP Dependency Track site and download the latest release.

### Step 2

Follow the installation instructions for OWASP Dependency Track on their official documentation.

### Step 3

Once the installation is complete, navigate to the OWASP Dependency Track user interface.

### Step 4

Upload the BOM file generated by CycloneDX to OWASP Dependency Track. To do this, go to "Projects", create a new project, and then upload your BOM file under the "BOM" tab.

## Part 3: SBOM Generation and Evaluation

### Step 1

Now, use OWASP Dependency Track to generate the SBOM. This tool will parse the BOM file you uploaded, identifying all components and their associated vulnerabilities.

### Step 2

Review the SBOM. Pay particular attention to the identified vulnerabilities and the severity ratings assigned by the OWASP Dependency Track.

### Step 3

Evaluate the security risks associated with each dependency and consider ways to mitigate potential threats. This might involve updating a component to a newer version, replacing a component with a more secure alternative, or adjusting your application code to minimize the impact of a component's vulnerability.

**Remember, the main goal of this exercise is to familiarize you with using these two tools to generate and evaluate an SBOM, thereby improving the security of your software project. Good luck!**

## QA

1. **What is the purpose of CycloneDX?**
   - a) To generate a list of dependencies in an application
   - b) To generate an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
   - c) To evaluate the vulnerabilities of an application
   - d) To replace weak or predictable random number generators in applications

2. **What does OWASP Dependency Track allow you to do?**
   - a) Create a BOM (Bill of Materials)
   - b) Parse a BOM and identify all components and their associated vulnerabilities
   - c) Generate secure cryptographic keys
   - d) Generate unpredictable password hashes

3. **What is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)?**
   - a) A list of cryptographic keys used in an application
   - b) A list of vulnerabilities in an application
   - c) A list of all components (libraries, dependencies) used in a piece of software
   - d) A list of all the random numbers generated by an application

4. **Why is it important to maintain updated dependencies in your application?**
   - a) Older versions are always less efficient
   - b) To ensure compatibility with new hardware
   - c) Older versions often have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited
   - d) New versions have more features

5. **What is one way to mitigate risks associated with dependencies in an SBOM?**
   - a) Update a component to a newer version
   - b) Use more dependencies to diversify risk
   - c) Include less information in the SBOM
   - d) Increase the complexity of the application code

6. **What does 'cyclonedx-bom' command do**
   - a) It launches the application
   - b) It generates a Bill of Materials (BOM)
   - c) It lists all installed Node.js packages
   - d) It upgrades all outdated dependencies

7. **In which tab of the OWASP Dependency Track user interface can you upload your BOM file?**
   - a) The "Dependencies" tab
   - b) The "Projects" tab
   - c) The "BOM" tab
   - d) The "Upload" tab
